Tired of searching the world wide web every time you open your browser for resources regarding placements? Do you hate it when you lose all the placement related tabs and any progress associated with it? If your answer is yes and yes then I got everything covered for you. I faced the same problem during my placement preparations so I developed this handy little tool to help me out and I'm sure it'll help you out as well so that nothing stops you from getting that dream job of yours. This tool contains all the updated placement related resources to help you prepare for your placements. From coding problems asked by companies to MCQs, general aptitude, youtube tutorials, and even interview and HR round preparation. This little tool has every resource available to you in just a click. I keep on updating it with the latest and best resources so that you don't have to waste any time searching for it and spend your energy on the thing that matters the most, your placement. I wish you all very successful placements ahead.
